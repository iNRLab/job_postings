Within the **Integrative Neuromodulation and Recovery (iN*R) Lab** directed by Dr. Kirstin-Friederike Heise at the MUSC [Department of Health Sciences and Research](https://chp.musc.edu/about/departments/health-sciences-and-research), we study learning and memory mechanisms in people across the adult lifespan with and without brain injury. In our team, we use a multimodal methodological approach, including behavioral modeling, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), electroencephalography (EEG), and non-invasive brain stimulation (e.g., transcranial magnetic stimulation, TMS, transcranial alternating current stimulation, tACS).

In the iN*R lab, we embrace an inclusive working environment and expect openness to interdisciplinary work and collaboration, including the willingness to communicate and exchange knowledge with international team members of various professional disciplines and cultural backgrounds. The Medical University of South Carolina is an equal opportunity employer and makes employment decisions without regard to race, age, gender, gender identity, disability, or protected veteran status. 

Our lab is part of the [NIH Center of Biomedical Research Excellence in Stroke Recovery](https://chp.musc.edu/research/stroke-recovery) at the Medical University of South Carolina, and we collaborate with the [Brain Stimulation Lab](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/psychiatry/divisions-and-programs/divisions/bsl), and the [Center for Biomedical Imaging](https://medicine.musc.edu/departments/centers/cbi) and are involved in the [NIH National Center of Neuromodulation for Rehabilitation](https://chp.musc.edu/research/nc-nm4r/about-ncnm4r). 

Finally, Charleston, South Carolina, is one of the US’ most beautifully preserved architectural and historical treasures and offers a wide variety of history, culture, arts, recreation, and beautiful beaches. With 120.000 inhabitants, Charleston is the second largest city in South Carolina, situated midway up the state’s Atlantic Ocean coastline at the confluence of Ashley and Cooper Rivers.
